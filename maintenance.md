**MAINTENANCE & CARE Instructions**

**Wood Surfaces Cleaning and Care Instructions**

Cleaning Instructions

Note: Always wipe with the grain.

- Dust with a damp, soft cloth and dry the surface completely.
- If needed, clean with a small amount of non-alkaline dish soap in warm water. Avoid waxes, solvents, ammonia, and other chemicals.
- Frequent polishing is not recommended. If needed, use a no-wax liquid polish on a soft cloth. Immediately buff surface until dry. Before
  re-polishing, eliminate existing polish with a wax remover. If not removed, surface could appear streaky.

Care Instructions

- Immediately blot any liquids from the surface.
- Avoid extreme heat, cold, or wide humidity variances. Prolonged sunlight could affect the color of the wood beneath the finish.
- Use a desk pad to protect furniture from possible damage caused by pens and sharp objects.
- If using a protective glass top, place felt or cork spacers under the glass to allow the wood to breathe.
- Prolonged contact wtih plastic, vinyl, or rubber items may cause deterioration of the finish due to a chemical reaction. Place felt pads under these
  items to protect the wood surface.

Chair Cleaning and Care Instructions

- Finishes. For day-to-day cleaning, wipe with a damp cloth. For heavy-duty cleaning, use a commercial no-wax liquid polish intended for wood
  furniture; wipe with a clean dry cloth.
- Fabrics. Light stains can be removed with textile cleaner or a sponge damped in water or a mild soapy solution.
- Leathers. Wipe over stain with a cheese cloth soaked in a mild soap and warm water solution. Rinse soap film with a cheese cloth dampened in clean,
  warm water. Finish by wiping with a dry, soft cloth.
- Pneumatic mechanisms. To ensure the proper function of the pneumatic height adjustment, the mechanism should be activated twice weekly. If the
  mechanism is left unused for a period of weeks, you may have difficulty adjusting the height of the chair.
